# Sms-classifier
An SMS classifier is a tool used to automatically distinguish between spam (unwanted or junk) and ham (legitimate) messages. It is crucial for enhancing user experience by filtering out unsolicited and potentially harmful content, such as advertisements, scams, and phishing attempts. This classification helps keep users' inboxes clean and safe.
